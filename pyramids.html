        <h1> 3) Pyramids </h1>
        <br> 
        <p>The age of the pyramids reached its zenith at Giza in 2575â€“2150 BC.[11] Ancient Egyptian pyramids were in most cases placed west of the river Nile because the divine pharaoh's soul was meant to join with the sun during its descent before continuing with the sun in its eternal round.[9] As of 2008, some 135 pyramids have been discovered in Egypt.[12][13] The Great Pyramid of Giza is the largest in Egypt and one of the largest in the world. At 481 ft, it was the tallest building in the world until Lincoln Cathedral was finished in 1311 AD. The base is over 52,600 square metres (566,000 sq ft) in area. The Great Pyramid of Giza is one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World. It is the only one to survive into modern times. The Ancient Egyptians covered the faces of pyramids with polished white limestone, containing great quantities of fossilized seashells.[14] Many of the facing stones have fallen or have been removed and used for construction in Cairo.

            Most pyramids are located near Cairo, with only one royal pyramid being located south of Cairo, at the Abydos temple complex. The pyramids at Abydos, Egypt were commissioned by Ahmose I who founded the 18th Dynasty and the New Kingdom.[15] The building of pyramids began in the Third Dynasty with the reign of King Djoser.[16] Early kings such as Snefru built several pyramids, with subsequent kings adding to the number of pyramids until the end of the Middle Kingdom.
            
            The last king to build royal pyramids was Ahmose,[17] with later kings hiding their tombs in the hills, such as those in the Valley of the Kings in Luxor's West Bank.[18] In Medinat Habu, or Deir el-Medina, smaller pyramids were built by individuals. Smaller pyramids with steeper sides were also built by the Nubians who ruled Egypt in the Late Period
